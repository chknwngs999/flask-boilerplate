# Flask Tutorial Blog Site

This is a sample blog site created by following the official [Flask tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/tutorial/).

## Installation

This project is not installable as of right now. This may come in the future. I have a wheel file, but I don't know if that works. This will be updated as I learn more.

## Usage

This project is a web application. You can register for an account (that will be stored locally if you download this program), login with said account, and create, update, and delete your own blog posts.
Screenshots may be attached in the future.

## Authors and Acknowledgments

Thanks to Flask for being cool. Also thanks to [Make a README](https://www.makeareadme.com/) and [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). I'd be a little lost without those resources.

## Project Status

Probably will not develop this project much. Will probably clone it for other projects.
Only updates will probably come when I migrate from SQLite to PostGreSQL, but that might just be a different project or something. Also may update with the flask official tutorial.
